# SQL is ...

- still going strong 40 years after its inception
- in high demand
- extremely optimized after so many years of heavy use
    - speed
    - storage
    - security
- restricted in its use:
    - mainly relational database
    - originally intended for transaction processing, not analytics
- only covering part of the analytics process:
    - data retrieval (querying)
    - data transformation
- lacking
    - ETL facilities
    - capabilities to easily merge non relational data
    - visualization facilities
    - more than just simple statistics capabilities

# SQL in the data analysis process

- has its role, even with the restrictions mentioned
- mainly in querying relational data (SELECT statement)
- insufficient to conduct a full analysis

# Should I learn SQL?

- yes, because it is in high demand
- no: because there are other tools covering a much larger area of the analysis process
- in practice: learn SQL if you work in an environment where most of the data resides in relational databases
- always learn Excel and R or python as well
- depending on your environment learn Power BI, Tableau, QlikView or any other visualization tool
- Power BI is becoming the next Excel (for reporting purposes)
