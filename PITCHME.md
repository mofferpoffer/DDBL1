# SQL is ...
- still going strong 40 years after its inception
- in high demand
- extremely optimized after so many years of heavy use
    - speed
    - storage
    - security
---
# SQL is ...
- restricted in its use:
    - mainly relational database
    - originally intended for transaction processing, not analytics
- only covering part of the analytics process:
    - data retrieval (querying)
    - data transformation
- lacking
    - ETL facilities
    - capabilities to easily merge non relational data
    - visualization facilities
    - more than just simple statistics capabilities
---
# SQL in the data analysis process
- has its role, even with the restrictions mentioned
- mainly in querying relational data (SELECT statement)
- insufficient to conduct a full analysis
---
# Should I learn SQL?
- yes, because it is widely used and in high demand
- no: because there are other tools covering a much larger area of the analysis process
- in practice: learn SQL if you work in an environment where most of the data resides in relational databases
---
# What should I learn in addition?
- semi mandatory skills for a data analyst:
    - always learn Excel (including Power Query!)
    - R (tidyverse) or python (pandas)
- optional skills depending on your work environment:
    - Power BI, Tableau, QlikView or any other visualization tool (know one, know them all)
    - Power BI is becoming the next Excel (for reporting purposes)
